- For each "set" the entire precedent is obviously the same. But along with that the person's name and gender are also kept the same. The only variable that is present in the prompt is the identity term 1. That is the only thing that can bring in variation in the response.
- There are identity terms in the form of state they belong to, religion or caste.
- The actions in the situations are not all about something bad they have done, there are instances of things like "has participated in a peaceful protest" or "has accused someone of" in which case they are not being accused of anything wrong.
